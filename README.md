# ComfyWeb v2 - Enhanced Workflow Interface

ComfyWeb v2 is an enhanced interface for ComfyUI that replaces complex node graphs with intuitive HTML forms while maintaining full compatibility with ComfyUI workflows.

## Features

### üéØ **Core Functionality**
- **Simple and intuitive interface** with HTML forms instead of graphs! You can easily create and edit workflows without having to worry about the underlying graph structure.
- **Unified gallery view** that allows you to easily preview, edit and manage both generated images as well as anything that's pending in the queue.
- **Drag and drop support** for ComfyUI images and workflows - they are automatically converted to a simple sequence of forms (some complex graphs might be rejected). Images generated with ComfyWeb can be loaded with ComfyUI (although they're not guaranteed to be pretty!).

### ‚ú® **Enhanced Features (v2)**
- **Local Workflow Storage**: Save and load workflows directly in your browser
- **Missing Node Detection**: Automatic detection of required custom nodes with installation UI
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Fixed critical bugs and improved workflow validation  
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Modern, responsive interface with improved typography
- **Template System**: Quick-start templates for common workflows
- **Single File Deployment**: Builds to one HTML file for easy sharing

## üöÄ Quick Installation (Recommended)

### **One-Click Setup Scripts**

**Windows Users:**
```cmd
# Download and run the complete installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtaava/comfywebv2/main/install-windows.bat
install-windows.bat
```

**Linux/macOS Users:**
```bash
# Download and run the complete installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtaava/comfywebv2/main/install-linux.sh
chmod +x install-linux.sh
./install-linux.sh
```

### **What the installer does:**
- ‚úÖ Checks for Python 3.8+, Git, and Node.js 18+
- ‚úÖ Downloads and installs ComfyUI with all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Installs ComfyUI Manager (for custom nodes)
- ‚úÖ Downloads and builds ComfyWeb v2
- ‚úÖ Creates convenient launch scripts
- ‚úÖ Sets up everything in a `ComfyWebSetup` folder

### **After installation:**
```bash
# Start both ComfyUI and ComfyWeb v2 together
launch-both.bat        # Windows
./launch-both.sh       # Linux/macOS
```

## üìã Prerequisites

The installation scripts will check for these automatically:

**Required:**
- **Python 3.8+** - For running ComfyUI
- **Node.js 18+** - For building ComfyWeb v2
- **Git** - For downloading repositories

**GPU Support (Optional but Recommended):**
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster image generation
- AMD GPU with ROCm support (Linux)

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer to install manually or customize the setup:

### 1. Install ComfyUI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install ComfyWeb v2
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtaava/comfywebv2.git
cd comfywebv2
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Launch Manually
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start ComfyUI
cd ComfyUI
python main.py --enable-cors-header "*"

# Terminal 2: Open ComfyWeb v2
# Open comfywebv2/dist/index.html in your browser
```

## üéÆ Usage

### **First Time Setup:**
1. Run the installer script for your platform
2. Use `launch-both` script to start everything
3. ComfyWeb v2 will open in your browser automatically
4. Configure ComfyUI server address if needed (usually http://127.0.0.1:8188)

### **Daily Usage:**
- **Quick Start**: Run `launch-both` script
- **ComfyUI Only**: Run `launch-comfyui` script  
- **ComfyWeb Only**: Run `launch-comfyweb` script (requires ComfyUI running)

### **Remote Server:**
If connecting to a remote ComfyUI server, configure the hostname in the 'Manage' tab.

## üîß Development

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtaava/comfywebv2.git
cd comfywebv2
npm install
npm run build          # Production build
npm run dev            # Development server
```

### Project Structure
```
comfywebv2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/               # Source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/              # Built application (index.html)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install-*.sh/bat   # Installation scripts

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**"Command not found" errors:**
- Make sure Python, Node.js, and Git are installed and in your PATH
- Windows: Restart command prompt after installing
- Linux/macOS: Restart terminal or source your profile

**ComfyUI won't start:**

**ComfyWeb v2 can't connect:**
- Ensure ComfyUI is running with CORS enabled
- Check the server address in ComfyWeb's 'Manage' tab
- Default should be: http://127.0.0.1:8188

**GPU not detected:**
- Install appropriate PyTorch version for your GPU
- NVIDIA: Use CUDA index URL in the installer
- AMD: Use ROCm version of PyTorch
