# ComfyWeb v2 - Enhanced Workflow Interface

ComfyWeb v2 is an enhanced interface for ComfyUI that replaces complex node graphs with intuitive HTML forms while maintaining full compatibility with ComfyUI workflows.

## Features

### üéØ **Core Functionality**
- **Simple and intuitive interface** with HTML forms instead of graphs! You can easily create and edit workflows without having to worry about the underlying graph structure.
- **Unified gallery view** that allows you to easily preview, edit and manage both generated images as well as anything that's pending in the queue.
- **Drag and drop support** for ComfyUI images and workflows - they are automatically converted to a simple sequence of forms (some complex graphs might be rejected). Images generated with ComfyWeb can be loaded with ComfyUI (although they're not guaranteed to be pretty!).

### ‚ú® **Enhanced Features (v2)**
- **Local Workflow Storage**: Save and load workflows directly in your browser
- **Missing Node Detection**: Automatic detection of required custom nodes with installation UI
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Fixed critical bugs and improved workflow validation  
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Modern, responsive interface with improved typography
- **Template System**: Quick-start templates for common workflows
- **Single File Deployment**: Builds to one HTML file for easy sharing

## Usage

Start ComfyUI with CORS enabled:
```bash
python main.py --enable-cors-header '*'
```

**Getting ComfyWeb v2:**
